**Applies To:**
- Implementation plans
- Technical analyses

- Code implementation plans
- Deployment strategies

**Does NOT Apply To:**

Instead of using `write_to_file` for documentation, Roo should:
1. Format content using proper markdown syntax
2. Present directly in chat response
3. Use clear headings, code blocks, lists
