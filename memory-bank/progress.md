## 1. What Works / Completed (as of 2025-05-15)

-   **Project Setup & Core Dependencies:** (Stable)
-   **Basic App Structure & Navigation:** (Stable)
-   **Theming & Styling:** (Stable, `playingGreen` color added previously)
-   **Font Loading:** (Stable)
-   **Layout Management:** (Stable)
-   **Home Screen (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`):** (Stable)
-   **Surahs Screen (`app/(tabs)/surahs.tsx`):** (Stable)
-   **Reader Screen (`app/(tabs)/reader.tsx`):**
    -   **Data Fetching (Hybrid Model):**
        -   Fetches Arabic Quranic text from Neon PostgreSQL DB via Vercel Serverless Functions (using `src/services/apiClient.ts`).
        -   Fetches Surah list and Yusuf Ali translations from Vercel Blob (JSON files).
        -   `src/services/surahService.ts` orchestrates this hybrid data retrieval.
    -   **Audio Playback & Controls (using `expo-audio` via `useAudioPlayer.ts`):**
        -   (Details of audio stability refactor, precision fix, tap-to-play, visual sync, accessibility remain as previously documented and stable)
-   **Vercel Serverless Functions (`api/*.ts`):**
    -   Implemented `api/get-verses.ts` and `api/get-verse.ts` to query Neon PostgreSQL DB for Quranic text.
    -   Implemented `api/get-metadata.ts` to retrieve metadata (needs module syntax fix).
    -   Configured with `pg` for database connection.
-   **`src/services/apiClient.ts`:**
    -   Implemented to make `fetch` requests to Vercel Serverless Functions.
    -   Handles API responses and basic error logging.
    -   Includes `fetchMetadataFromAPI` for retrieving metadata.
-   **`src/services/quranMetadataService.ts`:**
    -   Implemented to fetch metadata from Edge Config with API fallback.
    -   Provides methods for retrieving surah lists, sajda verses, and navigation indices.
-   **`src/services/surahService.ts`:**
    -   **Modified:** Integrates `apiClient.ts` to fetch Arabic text.
    -   Continues to fetch Surah list and translations directly from Vercel Blob.
    -   Combines data from both sources to provide complete `Verse` objects.
-   **`src/services/audioService.ts`:** (Stable, constructs audio URLs for Vercel Blob)
-   **`src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts`:** (Stable, as previously documented regarding audio playback logic)
-   **UI Components (`VerseCard.tsx`, `PlatformSlider.tsx`, `AudioControlBar.tsx`):** (Stable, with precision fixes as previously documented)
-   **Data Migration (Initial):** Original migration of static JSON content to Vercel Blob was completed. (Arabic text portion is now superseded by DB/API).
-   **`tsconfig.json`:** (`"dom"` lib added previously, stable)

## 2. What's Left to Build / Fix (High-Level for Expo Port)

-   **Fix API Module Syntax Issue:**
    -   Create a specialized `tsconfig.json` for the `/api` directory that uses CommonJS modules.
    -   Update Vercel configuration to specify how API routes should be built.
    -   Configure the Edge Config environment variable in Vercel project settings.
    -   Implement local fallback for Edge Config for development environments.
-   **Thorough Testing of Hybrid Data Retrieval & Audio System:**
    -   **Data Flow:**
        -   Verify correct fetching and display of Arabic text from API/DB across various Surahs/verses.
        -   Verify correct fetching and display of translations and Surah list from Vercel Blob.
        -   Test error handling scenarios (API down, DB error, missing Blob files).
    -   **Audio Stability:** (As previously listed - verify stability, controls, UI indicators, precision, accessibility, autoplay)
-   **UI Implementation & Refinement (All Screens - Post Audio Test):** (As before)
-   **Core Quran Functionality (Post Audio Test):** (As before)
-   **Data Layer Expansion:** (As before)
-   **Theming & Styling:** (As before)
-   **Cross-Platform Polish & Testing.** (As before)

## 3. Current Status

-   **Overall:** The application now features a hybrid data model, with Arabic Quranic text served dynamically via Vercel Serverless Functions from a Neon PostgreSQL database. Translations, Surah lists, and audio files continue to be served from Vercel Blob. The audio playback system is stable and reliable due to the comprehensive refactor.
-   **Current Issue:** Identified module syntax errors in the `api/get-metadata.ts` function due to TypeScript configuration mismatch. The Vercel logs show "Unexpected token 'export'" and "EDGE_CONFIG connection string not found" errors that need to be addressed.
-   **Current Task Group:** Creating a solution plan for the API module syntax issue and finalizing Memory Bank documentation for the new architecture.
-   **Next Major Feature Focus:** Implementing the API module syntax fix and thorough testing of both the new API-driven data retrieval for Arabic text and the stable audio system across all platforms.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers / Considerations (Current)

-   **API Module Syntax Error:**
    -   The `api/get-metadata.ts` file is using ES module syntax while Vercel serverless functions expect CommonJS.
    -   TypeScript configuration mismatch - global `tsconfig.json` set to `"module": "esnext"` but Vercel needs CommonJS.
    -   Edge Config connection string not properly configured in Vercel environment variables.
    -   Solution plan created in `memory-bank/solution-vercel-api-module-syntax.md`.
-   **Testing Required (Data & Audio):**
    -   The new API-driven data flow for Arabic text needs thorough testing for correctness, performance, and error handling on all target platforms.
    -   The comprehensive audio architecture also requires continued thorough testing (as previously noted).
-   **Web Slider Styling:** (As before)
-   **Lottie Animation Loop:** (As before)
-   **ReaderScreen Content:** (As before)
