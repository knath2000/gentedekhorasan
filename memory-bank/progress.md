# Progress: Luminous Verses (Expo App)

**Version:** 0.9.2 (Comprehensive Audio Stability & UI Sync)
**Date:** 2025-05-14
**Related Brief:** `docs/projectbrief.md`
**Active Context:** `docs/activeContext.md` (Version 0.9.1)
**Refactoring Plan (Precision):** `docs/audio_playback_refactoring_strategy.md` (or similar)

## 1. What Works / Completed (as of 2025-05-14)

-   **Project Setup & Core Dependencies:** (Stable)
-   **Basic App Structure & Navigation:** (Stable)
-   **Theming & Styling:** (Stable, `playingGreen` color added previously)
-   **Font Loading:** (Stable)
-   **Layout Management:** (Stable)
-   **Home Screen (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`):** (Stable)
-   **Surahs Screen (`app/(tabs)/surahs.tsx`):** (Stable)
-   **Reader Screen (`app/(tabs)/reader.tsx`):**
    -   Fetches and displays Quranic data from Vercel Blob.
    -   **Audio Playback & Controls (using `expo-audio` via `useAudioPlayer.ts` - formerly `useQuranAudioPlayer.ts`):**
        -   **Comprehensive Stability Refactor Implemented:** Achieved robust and reliable audio playback through a 'play-on-create' (mono-instance) player lifecycle and strict event-driven UI state synchronization. This resolved previous issues with stuck buffering UI, desynchronized controls (slider, play/pause buttons), and unreliable toggle behaviors.
        -   **Precision Fix Integrated:** Addressed "Loss of precision" errors by ensuring all millisecond-based time values are rounded.
        -   **Tap-to-Play/Pause Refined:** `VerseCard` handles tap events reliably.
        -   **Visual State Synchronized:** `VerseCard` visual state (playing, paused, buffering) and playback slider are now accurately driven by player events.
        -   **Accessibility Enhanced:** `VerseCard` and `PlatformSlider` have updated accessibility props, benefiting from stable state.
-   **`src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts`:**
    -   Successfully uses the library-provided `useAudioPlayer` from `expo-audio`.
    -   Implements a 'play-on-create' (mono-instance) lifecycle and event-driven state updates via a reducer for robust UI synchronization.
    -   Manages audio state (loading, playing, paused, buffering, time, duration, errors).
    -   Provides core audio control functions (`toggleAudio`, `stopAudio`, `seekAudio`).
    -   **Modified:** Returns rounded `durationMillis` and `positionMillis`. `seekAudio` handles rounded input.
-   **`src/components/VerseCard.tsx`:**
    -   Refactored for tap-to-play/pause and accessibility.
    -   **Modified:** Rounds `positionMillis` and `durationMillis` props before use with `PlatformSlider` and `formatTime`. `formatTime` also rounds its input.
-   **`src/components/PlatformSlider.tsx`:**
    -   Updated for accessibility props.
    -   **Modified:** Rounds all numeric props and `accessibilityValue` fields passed to native/web sliders. Rounds values from web slider event handlers.
-   **`src/components/AudioControlBar.tsx`:**
    -   **Verified:** No changes needed for precision fix as it receives already rounded values and its `formatTime` is robust.
-   **`src/services/surahService.ts` & `src/services/audioService.ts`:** (Stable)
-   **Data Migration to Vercel Blob:** (Completed)
-   **`tsconfig.json`:** (`"dom"` lib added previously, stable)

## 2. What's Left to Build / Fix (High-Level for Expo Port)

-   **Thorough Testing of Comprehensive Audio Stability Refactor:**
    -   Verify overall audio playback stability, responsiveness of controls (play, pause, resume, seek), and accuracy of UI indicators (buffering icon, playing state, slider position) across iOS, Android, and Web.
    -   Confirm "loss of precision" errors remain eliminated.
    -   Test all accessibility features (VoiceOver, TalkBack) with the stable audio states.
    -   Confirm visual feedback (verse highlights, control states) is consistently accurate.
    -   Test autoplay interaction with the new audio architecture.
-   **UI Implementation & Refinement (All Screens - Post Audio Test):** (As before)
-   **Core Quran Functionality (Post Audio Test):** (As before)
-   **Data Layer Expansion:** (As before)
-   **Theming & Styling:** (As before)
-   **Cross-Platform Polish & Testing.** (As before)

## 3. Current Status

-   **Overall:** The audio playback system is now significantly more stable and reliable due to a comprehensive refactor focusing on event-driven state synchronization and a mono-instance 'play-on-create' player pattern. This resolved prior issues with UI desynchronization (stuck buffering, slider inaccuracies) and toggle logic. Numeric precision fixes have also been integrated.
-   **Current Task Group:** Memory Bank Documentation & Final Audio System Verification.
-   **Next Major Feature Focus:** Thorough testing of the newly architected audio system across all platforms to confirm stability and expected behavior.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers / Considerations (Current)

-   **Testing Required:** The new comprehensive audio architecture (event-driven state, mono-instance player, UI sync fixes, precision enhancements) needs thorough testing on all target platforms (iOS, Android, Web) and with assistive technologies to confirm stability, expected UX, and identify any regressions.
-   **Web Slider Styling:** (As before)
-   **Lottie Animation Loop:** (As before)
-   **ReaderScreen Content:** (As before)
