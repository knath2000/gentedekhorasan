# Progress: Luminous Verses (Expo App)

**Version:** 0.5 (Audio Controls Refinement & Tap-to-Toggle Fix)
**Date:** 2025-05-12
**Related Brief:** `docs/projectbrief.md`
**Active Context:** `docs/activeContext.md`

## 1. What Works / Completed (as of 2025-05-12)

-   **Project Setup & Core Dependencies:**
    -   Expo project initialized.
    -   Key dependencies installed and functional.
    -   TypeScript and ESLint configured.
-   **Basic App Structure & Navigation:**
    -   Expo Router setup for tab-based navigation.
    -   Root layout handles font loading, `SafeAreaProvider`, and `ThemeProvider`.
    -   Screens created: Home, Surahs, Reader, Bookmarks (placeholder), Settings (placeholder).
-   **Theming & Styling:**
    -   `styled-components` integrated with `ThemeProvider`.
    -   Basic theme defined and functional.
    -   TypeScript definitions for theme in place.
-   **Font Loading:**
    -   Custom fonts (Noto Naskh Arabic, Montserrat) loaded asynchronously.
-   **Layout Management:**
    -   `react-native-safe-area-context` integrated.
    -   React Native `Dimensions` API used for dynamic layout calculations.
-   **Home Screen (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`):**
    -   Displays "Home Screen" title.
    -   Native: Lottie animation plays once and then freezes.
    -   Web: Static background image displayed.
-   **Surahs Screen (`app/(tabs)/surahs.tsx`):**
    -   Fetches and displays the list of Surahs from Supabase.
    -   Uses themed background and dynamic layout.
    -   Uses `SurahCard.tsx` component.
-   **Reader Screen (`app/(tabs)/reader.tsx`):**
    -   Fetches and displays Arabic text for Surah Al-Fatihah.
    -   **Audio Playback & Controls:**
        -   Audio playback for Surah 1 verses implemented using `expo-av` via `useAudioPlayer` custom hook.
        -   Tapping a `VerseCard` correctly toggles play/pause for that verse.
        -   `AudioControlBar.tsx` now displays only a Stop button (stops and resets audio) and a Skip Next button, along with time display.
        -   `VerseCard.tsx` contains the playback slider and shows its internal buffering indicator *only* during the initial audio load (`isLoadingAudio`).
        -   Verse highlighting (`VerseCard.tsx`) correctly syncs with audio playback state.
    -   Robust state management for audio playback, addressing issues with premature control disappearance, state synchronization, and race conditions.
-   **`useAudioPlayer.ts` Hook:**
    -   Manages audio state, playback lifecycle, and interactions with `expo-av`.
    -   Includes robust `stopAudio` logic (via `stopCurrentAudioAndReset`) and cleanup mechanisms.
    -   `toggleAudio` function correctly handles:
        -   Playing a new verse.
        -   Pausing a playing verse.
        -   Resuming a paused verse.
    -   `operationInProgressRef` is managed correctly to prevent blocking subsequent tap actions.
    -   Correctly uses `InterruptionModeIOS.DoNotMix` and `InterruptionModeAndroid.DoNotMix`.
    -   Manages `activeVerseNumber` (user-selected) and `playingVerseNumber` (audio engine target).
    -   Refined `isLoading` state management.
-   **Supabase Integration:**
    -   Supabase client initialized and functional.
    -   Service layer for Surah list fetching.
    -   Successfully fetching data for Surah list and Surah 1 text.
-   **Metro Bundler Configuration (`metro.config.js`):**
    -   Custom polyfills configured and working.
-   **Asset Management:**
    -   Lottie animation, fonts, and images stored and accessible.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Fix (High-Level for Expo Port)

*(This section outlines the overall scope. Detailed next steps will be in `docs/activeContext.md`)*

-   **UI Implementation & Refinement (All Screens):**
    -   Enhance `ReaderScreen`:
        -   Display English translations.
        -   Full Surah text display and navigation (not just Surah 1).
    -   Implement UI for `BookmarksScreen` and `SettingsScreen`.
    -   Refine Home screen (continuous Lottie animation, consistent background across platforms).
    -   Implement custom Tab Bar if desired.
-   **Core Quran Functionality:**
    -   Fetch and display all Surahs and their verses.
    -   Expand audio playback system (e.g., different reciters, background audio improvements, full Surah audio).
    -   Bookmarking functionality.
-   **Data Layer Expansion:**
    -   Structure Supabase data for all Surahs, verses, translations, and audio metadata.
    -   Implement robust error handling and loading states for all data operations.
    -   Caching strategies for Quran data.
-   **Theming & Styling:**
    -   Full implementation of "Desert Oasis at Night" theme across all components and screens.
    -   Create more reusable themed components.
-   **State Management:**
    -   Implement global state management for user preferences, etc., if complexity grows beyond custom hooks.
-   **Cross-Platform Polish & Testing:**
    -   Thorough testing on iOS, Android, and Web.
    -   Address platform-specific UI/UX quirks.
    -   Performance optimization.
    -   Accessibility improvements.
-   **Known Issues (to be addressed):**
    -   Lottie animation on Home screen (native) plays once and freezes.
    -   Web background on Home screen is a static placeholder.

## 3. Current Status

-   **Overall:** Core app structure with tab navigation is stable. Audio playback for Surah 1 is robust, with refined UI controls and correct tap-to-toggle (play/pause) functionality. Surahs screen displays data correctly. Key infrastructure (theming, fonts, Supabase, polyfills) is functional.
-   **Current Task Group:** Updating Memory Bank files and `.clinerules` after successfully refining audio control UI and fixing tap-to-toggle playback.
-   **Next Major Feature Focus:** Likely to be addressing Home screen Lottie/background issues or expanding `ReaderScreen` content (all Surahs, translations).

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers / Considerations (Current)

-   **Lottie Animation Loop:** The Lottie animation on the native Home screen does not loop.
-   **Web Home Screen Background:** Placeholder image needs replacement.
-   **Data for All Surahs (Reader Screen):** Supabase needs full Quran text; Reader screen needs to handle dynamic Surah IDs.
-   **UI Component Library:** Continue building themed reusable components.
-   **Cross-Platform UI Consistency:** Ongoing effort.
-   **Performance of Lottie on Web:** Monitor if Lottie is chosen for web background.
