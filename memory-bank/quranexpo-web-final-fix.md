# quranexpo-web Final Fix - Output Directory Issue

## Status Update
✅ **pnpm issue resolved** - npx approach worked perfectly!
✅ **Dependencies installed** - All packages installed successfully
✅ **Astro build completed** - 118 pages built successfully
❌ **Deployment failed** - Vercel can't find the output directory

## The Problem
```
Error: No Output Directory named "dist" found after the Build completed.
```

The build creates the output at:
- `/vercel/path1/apps/quranexpo-web/dist/`

But Vercel is looking for:
- `/vercel/path1/dist/`

This is because the build script changes to the monorepo root but Vercel expects the output relative to where it started.

## Solution

### Update apps/quranexpo-web/vercel.json
The current vercel.json has:
```json
{
  "outputDirectory": "dist"
}
```

This needs to be updated to point to the correct location:
```json
{
  "outputDirectory": "apps/quranexpo-web/dist"
}
```

### Alternative: Update build.sh to copy dist
Add this at the end of build.sh:
```bash
# Copy dist to expected location
echo "Copiando dist al directorio esperado por Vercel..."
cp -r apps/quranexpo-web/dist ./dist
```

## Edge Config Warning (Non-critical)
The warning about Edge Config can be ignored for now or fixed by:
1. Adding `EDGE_CONFIG` environment variable in Vercel dashboard
2. Or making the Edge Config optional in the code

## Recommended Fix
Update `apps/quranexpo-web/vercel.json` with the correct output directory path. This is the cleanest solution.
