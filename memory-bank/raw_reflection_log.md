TaskRef: "Fix Surah Description Modal z-index and implement dimming/blurring effect"

Learnings:
- Understanding React/Preact usage in Astro: Vite aliases (`astro.config.mjs`) and `jsxImportSource` (`tsconfig.json`) are critical for determining the actual runtime UI library, even if both React and Preact dependencies are present. `preact/compat` enables seamless use of React ecosystem libraries with Preact.
- Modals and Z-index: For modals that need to appear above all content, using a Portal (like `preact/compat`'s `createPortal`) is the most robust solution. This lifts the modal out of restrictive stacking contexts created by parent elements (e.g., `position: relative`, `transform`, `filter`).
- Backdrop styling: `backdrop-blur` CSS property (via Tailwind's `backdrop-blur-Xl` classes) is effective for blurring content behind a translucent element. The visibility and intensity of this blur are highly dependent on the background color's opacity. A very low opacity (e.g., `bg-white/5`) makes the blur subtle, while a higher opacity (e.g., `bg-black/70`) provides more dimming.
- `replace_in_file` precision: `replace_in_file` requires exact `SEARCH` block matches. Auto-formatting or subtle changes can cause mismatches. `write_to_file` is a reliable fallback for such scenarios.

Difficulties:
- Initial `z-index` issue due to modal being rendered in-place without a portal.
- Iterative refinement of backdrop opacity and blur effect based on user feedback ("glassmorphic", "subtle", "dim by a lot"). This required multiple `replace_in_file` attempts and eventually a `write_to_file` fallback.
- Typo in `focusableElements` (`focusableableElements`) in `SurahDescriptionModal.tsx` which caused a TypeScript error.
- Repeated `replace_in_file` failures due to `SEARCH` block mismatches, indicating a need for more frequent file re-reads or direct `write_to_file` when the exact content is uncertain.

Successes:
- Successfully identified and implemented the Portal solution for the modal's z-index.
- Successfully adjusted the backdrop's appearance to meet user's evolving requirements (from blurred to subtly dimmed to heavily dimmed).
- Corrected the TypeScript typo.
- The overall task of fixing the modal's display and styling its backdrop was completed.
