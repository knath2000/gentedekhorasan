# quranexpo-web New Error Analysis

## Status Update (2025-05-26)

### ✅ Success: quran-data-api
- Deployment completed successfully
- The `.vercelignore` fix resolved the Prisma file conflicts
- API is now live and ready to use

### ❌ Failed: quranexpo-web
- Build script is executing successfully
- `pnpm install` (without --frozen-lockfile) is running
- NEW ERROR: HTTP request failures when fetching packages

## New Error Pattern

The build fails with multiple npm registry fetch errors:
```
WARN  GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@babel%2Fcore error (ERR_INVALID_THIS). Will retry in 10 seconds. 2 retries left.
ERR_PNPM_META_FETCH_FAIL  GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@babel%2Fcore: Value of "this" must be of type URLSearchParams
```

This error pattern suggests:
1. The lockfile incompatibility is causing pnpm to fetch fresh metadata
2. There's an issue with how pnpm is making HTTP requests in the Vercel environment
3. The error "ERR_INVALID_THIS" suggests a JavaScript context issue

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be related to:
1. **pnpm version mismatch**: The lockfile was generated with pnpm@10.x but the project specifies pnpm@9.1.4
2. **Vercel's build environment**: Something in the environment is causing HTTP request failures
3. **Missing lockfile compatibility**: Without a compatible lockfile, pnpm needs to resolve all dependencies fresh

## Solution Options

### Option B: Force pnpm version with Corepack
Since Option A partially worked but revealed a new issue, let's proceed with Option B to ensure the correct pnpm version is used.

### Option C: Alternative Build Strategy
If Option B fails, we have these alternatives:
1. Generate a new lockfile with the exact pnpm version
2. Use npm instead of pnpm for this specific project
3. Move the build process to the monorepo root

### Option D: Monorepo-level Build
Instead of using a custom build.sh, leverage TurboRepo's native build system.
