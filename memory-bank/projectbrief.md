    -   Quranic text display (Arabic, with English translations planned).
    -   Verse-by-verse audio playback (planned).
    -   Intuitive navigation using Expo Router.
-   **Cross-Platform Reach:** Target iOS, Android, and Web from a single codebase.
-   **Data Management:** Utilize Supabase for backend data storage and retrieval (e.g., Quranic text).

## 3. Target Audience

-   **Primary Demographic:** Tech-savvy individuals aged 15-21.
