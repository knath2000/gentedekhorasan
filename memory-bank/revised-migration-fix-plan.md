### Revised Implementation Plan: Turso to Neon DB Migration Fix

This plan outlines the necessary steps to refactor the Turso to Neon DB migration script to handle large datasets efficiently and prevent hanging issues. The core of this solution is to create a readable stream from the TursoDB data and pipe it directly to the `pg-copy-streams` writable stream.

**1. Refactor the Migration Script**

We will update the migration script to use a readable stream to pipe data from TursoDB to NeonDB, which will automatically handle backpressure.

*   **File to modify:** `scripts/migrate-turso-to-neon/index.ts`
*   **Modifications:**
    *   **Import `Readable` from `stream`:** Add `import { Readable } from 'stream';` to the import statements.
    *   **Create a `TursoStream` class:** I will create a new class `TursoStream` that extends `Readable` and will be responsible for fetching data from TursoDB in batches and pushing it into the stream.
    *   **Refactor `migrateTable` function:** I will replace the existing `migrateTable` function with a new implementation that uses the `TursoStream` class. The new function will perform the following steps:
        1.  Create a `TursoStream` instance for the table to be migrated.
        2.  Create a `COPY` stream to the target table in NeonDB.
        3.  Pipe the `TursoStream` to the `COPY` stream.
        4.  Include comprehensive error handling and progress logging.
    *   **Update `main` function:** Ensure the main `migrate` function correctly calls the new `migrateTable` function.

This plan will make the migration script more efficient and reliable, especially when dealing with large tables.
