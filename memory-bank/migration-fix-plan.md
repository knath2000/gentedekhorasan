### Implementation Plan: Turso to Neon DB Migration Fix

This plan outlines the necessary steps to refactor the Turso to Neon DB migration script to handle large datasets efficiently and prevent hanging issues. The core of this solution is to replace the current bulk `INSERT` statements with a more robust streaming approach using the `pg-copy-streams` library.

**1. Update `package.json`**

First, we need to add the `pg-copy-streams` library and its corresponding type definitions to the project's dependencies.

*   **File to modify:** `scripts/migrate-turso-to-neon/package.json`
*   **Action:** Add the following to `devDependencies`:
    *   `pg-copy-streams`: `^1.2.0`
    *   `@types/pg-copy-streams`: `^1.2.5`

**2. Refactor the Migration Script**

Next, we will update the migration script to use the new streaming approach.

*   **File to modify:** `scripts/migrate-turso-to-neon/index.ts`
*   **Modifications:**
    *   **Import `copyFrom`:** Add `import { from as copyFrom } from 'pg-copy-streams';` to the import statements.
    *   **Refactor `migrateTable` function:** Replace the existing `migrateTable` function with a new implementation that uses `pg-copy-streams`. This new function will:
        1.  Dynamically fetch the column list from the TursoDB schema.
        2.  Create a `COPY` stream to the target table in NeonDB.
        3.  Fetch data from TursoDB in batches of 100 records.
        4.  Write each batch to the `COPY` stream in a tab-delimited format.
        5.  Include comprehensive error handling and progress logging.
    *   **Update `main` function:** Ensure the main `migrate` function correctly calls the new `migrateTable` function.

This plan will make the migration script more efficient and reliable, especially when dealing with large tables. It also incorporates your preference for dynamic column management, which makes the script more resilient to schema changes.
